1. How might we drive a large volume of our non-AAdvantage® member customers to effortlessly enroll in the program during their customer journey without causing any friction in the operation?
2. How might we ensure customers have the right seat for them assigned by the time boarding starts so gate agents don't have to play musical chairs assigning seats?
3. How can we ensure customers show up to the airport ready to go straight to security with their boarding pass (if they don’t have a bag)? How do we ensure they know exactly what to do?
4. How might we encourage customers to add bags online and use our Express Kiosks?
5. How might we take the bag check process outside of the airport?
